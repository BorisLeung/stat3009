# Quick Start

\[Optional\] A python virtual environment is encouraged. Use the following command to initialize the virtual environment. Replace \<myenv\> with your own name for the environment.

```
conda env create --name <myenv> --file=env.yml
```

Install all the other dependencies with pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
